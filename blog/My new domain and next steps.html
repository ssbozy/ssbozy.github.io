                    <h2>My new domain and next steps</h2>
                    <h1 id="my-new-domain-and-next-steps">My new domain
                    and next steps</h1>
                    <p>I have been waiting for a long time to share this
                    news with everyone. Earlier this month, I was able
                    to procure my namesake domain. After a significant
                    wait​,​ I am the proud owner of <a
                    href="http://www.sandilya.com">www.sandilya.com</a>.
                    So what does this mean to me and everyone else.</p>
                    <p>For me​,​ it culminates my efforts to establish my
                    online presence and have a permanent home to
                    eve​r​y​thing​ related to me. For eve​r​yone else, it
                    would be the one location to easily find my updates
                    and acknowledge my work.</p>
                    <p>Over the coming weeks, I will be migrating all
                    the services from this domain to my new one. I am
                    expecting a very smooth transition with minimal
                    downtime. I an really looking forward to keep my new
                    home very busy with fresh and new content.</p>
