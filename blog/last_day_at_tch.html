                    <h2>Last day at Technicolor</h2>
                    <p>#Last day at Technicolor</p>
                    <p>After 8 years working for <a
                    href="http://technicolorbayarea.com">Technicolor
                    Research and Innovation</a>, I have decided itâ€™s
                    time to move on. Over these many years, I have
                    learnt a lot from some really amazing collegues and
                    ex-collegues. I was mentored by the always wonderful
                    <a href="http://bolot.org/">Jean Bolot</a>. I really
                    want to thank him for believing in me, placing his
                    trust in me and pushing me towards where I wanted to
                    be. Very rarely does anyone meet a mentor like him.
                    There are many such people I met at Technicolor whom
                    I want to thank today.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Ashwin Kashyap (first boss, best boss)</li>
                    <li>Saurabh Mathur</li>
                    <li>Peter Papatheodorou (how can I forget you Pete
                    :))</li>
                    <li>Brano Kveton</li>
                    <li>Nadia Fawaz (Thanks for being the one person I
                    could share everything.)</li>
                    <li>Brian Eriksson (Thank you for all the
                    advice)</li>
                    <li>Ajith Pudhiyaveetil (we started as Interns in
                    2010 and became best buddies for life)</li>
                    <li>Simon Feltman (only other guy with whom I could
                    nerd all day)</li>
                    <li>Akshay Pushparaja (I hired him as an intern but
                    became buddies soon)</li>
                    <li>Ken Nguyen (This guy is the best IT guy I have
                    met in ages. Also, best buddy)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I hope I did not forget anyone here. Every one of
                    you changed me one way or other. I have no hard
                    feelings or regrets. I always looked for an
                    opportunity to learn something from everyone of you.
                    I hope I was as helpful too to what you wanted to
                    achieve. Once again, it is emotional to say good bye
                    but I want to explore new challenges now and I hope
                    the best for everyone.</p>
                    <p><strong>THANK YOU TECHNICOLOR</strong></p>
